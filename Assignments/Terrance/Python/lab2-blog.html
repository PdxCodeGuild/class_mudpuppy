        <h3>Here Are Some of my Personal Favorite Vineyards in the Willamette Valley!</h3>

        <h2>Erath Winery</h2>
        <p>Erath wines are an expression of the land that the winery has cultivated for more than 40 years, longer than any other winery in the Dundee Hills of Oregon. The red, iron-rich Jory soils, combined with gentle breezes and warming sunshine of a marine climate, have bestowed upon Dundee a terroir of note. It has given rise to the handcrafting phenomenon, and the art of Pinot.
        
        As one of Oregon’s wine pioneers, Dick Erath had always been as tenacious in his approach to Pinot as the Pinot grape is stubborn. The engineer-turned-viticulturist was first inspired to pursue winemaking in 1965 after an early garage experiment. After completing coursework at UC-Davis in 1968, Erath relocated his family from California to the untamed red hills of Dundee. An unheated logger’s cabin on 49 acres would serve as home – and ad hoc winery – for several years.</p>

        <h2>Argyle Winery</h2>
        <p>In 1987, Argyle was founded by pioneering vintner Rollin Soles, with a belief that the cool-climate of Oregon’s Willamette Valley was ideal for producing sparkling wines. Our winemaking program now includes sparkling wines, Chardonnays, Pinot Noirs and Rieslings, which have earned acclaim for their elegance, vineyard-driven character and uncommon ageability. 

        While Argyle has quietly established a reputation as an Oregon icon, we have remained deeply rooted in the Willamette Valley community, and true to the grower-first ideals that inspired our founding. Today, our estate program includes more than 400 acres, with a remarkably diverse tapestry of microclimates, clonal and rootstock selections, elevations, exposures and soil types.</p>

        <h2>Granville Wines</h2>
        <p>Granville Wine Co. is a small family-owned vineyard and winery located in the Dundee Hills of the Willamette Valley. Led by second-generation wine growers Ayla & Jackson Holstein who focus on small lot productions of Pinot Noir & Chardonnay on their family’s Holstein Estate Vineyard.

        “The land is a part of our being, a part that must be treated with enduring dedication, patience, and humility. We recognize our relative existence to this land and embrace our role as short-term caretakers of these vines–it is fundamental to everything we do. With each passing season we see the fruits of time well-spent and vines well-loved. It is where we stand in times of both fortune and fallow. This is our home and we admire its complexity, adaptability, and generosity to our family.</p>

        <h2>Ken Wright Cellars</h2>
        <p>The seed for a career in wine was planted squarely in Bourbon country of Lexington, Kentucky. While waiting tables to put himself through school, Ken was exposed to fine wines from regions around the world. The passion became avocation when Ken left the Bluegrass State to attend enology and viticulture classes at UC-Davis. Eight years were spent winemaking for Ventana Vineyards, Chalone and Talbott Vineyards in Monterey County of California’s central coast.  Friends from the Willamette Valley piqued Ken’s interest in the region when they would visit, and a trip to the Dundee Hills in 1976 convinced him that this was where the finest Pinot noir in North America was being grown.
 
        In 1986, with family, belongings and 10 barrels in tow, Ken moved to McMinnville and started Panther Creek Cellars.  His concept of focusing on vineyard-designate bottling began during those years at Panther Creek and was cemented as a core philosophy in 1994 when Ken Wright Cellars was founded in historic downtown Carlton. Ken now makes a single vineyard bottling from 13 vineyard sites in the Northern Willamette Valley.</p>
