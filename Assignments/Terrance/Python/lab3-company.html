            WHY BUY A FRENCHIE? 
        </p>

        <P>
            French Bulldogs are one of the more popular dog breeds in the United States. Despite their name, they come from England, not France, and have been bred to be companion animals for several hundred years. Frenchies have the characteristic short muzzles of bulldogs, but are smaller than their traditional Bulldog counterparts. They are very playful and affectionate in nature, and love to be near their people. French Bulldogs, which tend to be no larger than 28 lbs. in adulthood, are adaptable to both small and large spaces, and are devoted pets to individuals and families.
        </P>

        <P>
            The French Bulldog resembles a Bulldog in miniature, except for the large, erect “bat ears” that are the breed’s trademark feature. The head is large and square, with heavy wrinkles rolled above the extremely short nose. The body beneath the smooth, brilliant coat is compact and muscular.
        </P>

        <P>
            The bright, affectionate Frenchie is a charmer. Dogs of few words, Frenchies don’t bark much—but their alertness makes them excellent watchdogs. They happily adapt to life with singles, couples, or families, and do not require a lot of outdoor exercise. They get on well with other animals and enjoy making new friends of the human variety. It is no wonder that city folk from Paris to Peoria swear by this vastly amusing and companionable breed.
        </P>

        <p>
            The French Bulldog has the appearance of an active, intelligent, muscular dog of heavy bone, smooth coat, compactly built, and of medium or small structure. Expression alert, curious, and interested. Any alteration other than removal of dewclaws is considered mutilation and is a disqualification. Proportion and Symmetry – All points are well distributed and bear good relation one to the other; no feature being in such prominence from either excess or lack of quality that the animal appears poorly proportioned.

            Want to connect with other people who love the same breed as much as you do? We have plenty of opportunities to get involved in your local community thanks to AKC Breed Clubs located in every state and more than 450 AKC Rescue Network groups across the country. The first specialty club to represent this breed was the French Bulldog Club of America and fanciers gave a specialty show at the Waldorf-Astoria in NYC in 1898. It was the first specialty show to be held in such quarters. Receiving serious press coverage, Frenchies were thrust into vogue, reaching a peak in 1913 with an entry of 100 at the Westminster Kennel Club.
