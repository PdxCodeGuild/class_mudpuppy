            Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials MJ,[6] is an American former professional basketball player and the principal owner of the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played 15 seasons in the NBA, winning six championships with the Chicago Bulls. His biography on the official NBA website states: "By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time."[7] He was one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation and was considered instrumental in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s.[8] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki Michael_Jordan">Michael Wiki</a>
