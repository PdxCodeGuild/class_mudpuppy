            <p>I really enjoy long walks and hiking. Walking is something that I can do all day! I really enjoy 
                Oregon's beautiful scenery, like how luck are we!!?! Another thing that I enjoy is cooking. This is 
                something that I find very thereputic but can also be exhausting at times- something I really only 
                enjoy doing when I want to do it, not when someone asks me to. Lastly, my favorite activity is reading 
                I love reading. I am not picky about the genre, as long as it is a good read and grabs my attention I
                I will read it.</p>
