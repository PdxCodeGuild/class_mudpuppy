# Hang 10 Proposal

## Outline
Somtimes the ocean be tricky and the waves won't always be clean? Login to our website save your favorite spots to surf and ride those smooth waves. Hang ten catch them loose and enjoy the forecast.

## What the app will do?
The app will pretty much ask a user to create a profile with the main intent of the profile to store the users email and Geographical Location. Once this has been done their geographical info along with their email and name will be stored on our database. We can create a user landing page where the sufing forcast will be displayed and updated in intervals. (If time allows maybe throw in a cool user controlled tracker that can take note if you will surf today or not???)

## Attainable goals
* Create user and store user Geographic location
* Use geographic location to pull up surfing conditions
* Display surfing conditions for user
* Set up timed updates while user is logged in

## Hopeful goals
* Maybe add a USER Controlled tracker that can annotate if you surfed that day or not?
