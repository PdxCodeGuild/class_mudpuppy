<!-- '''MOST BROWSERS USE HTML 5'''
'''Always use first 2 lines: 

<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> #holds the entire document 
<head>  blah blah blah </head>
    <title> is what shows up in the browser (the name) </title>
<body>      </body>

</html>#DOM OR DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL

'''

'''HTML is always saved as .htm w/ UTF-8 coding
tag has 3 parts = element name, attribute, value of the attribute and closing tag.


<a> = links,</a>

'''void elements'''
'''React requires that you close it with a slash'''


'''image, input, br, hr : are the most common ones you will be using'''

'''Meta Tags''' -->
<!--- This is how to make HTML Comments, however Django reads HTML signature-->
<!--- Pre-Processors, need to learn apart from class-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

<!-- Span is used for icons -->
<!-- ol ul and li are for lists -->

NEVER USE A STYLE TAG FOR CODE ORGANIZATION PRINCIPLES:

FORMS
<!-- Form is an element that allows us to submit user information using action tag and method tags
- information saved in form and then sent to server
- input element is the most common way to get this information.
    - html 5 deals with it differently: allows passwords to show up as little dots
    - highlights red when email is not a valid email address.
    - Once a valid email address is added it will allow you to send it.
    - Select gives you a drop down menu
    -input only allows users to pick one choice.
- Select gives you a drop down menu
- Input needs a label to go along with it
-Placeholder is gray and tells you smething needs t be in there
- We can disable inputs
-Pattern Attribute lets you use regular expressions to validate email address.
