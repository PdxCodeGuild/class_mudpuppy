#Project Name: Exposing Racism PNW
#Slogan: 


##App Description: blog/directory that records experiences of  racisms and allows them to be viewed publicly. Users can file complaints against businesses/people while also submitting proof of racist experiences. Users can look up if their favorite diners have mistreated guests or their responses to racism in their place of business. This allows users to be more aware of where their money is spent.

This also holds businesses accountable for the way that they treat and respond to customers. Each instances will be reviewed with the utmost diligence so that we are not accusing innocent businesses/people.


We currently have over 10,000 members on Facebook and have gotten many racists fired. 


Before I would ever release this app I would look into defamation suits and how or if I would be responsible for the things people say in their reviews.




#Priority 1: Safety and Security of our users
    - Each user must connect to their fb page.
    - Accounts take up to 24hrs to be approved.
    - If user does not have an account and is viewing via guest account, they will not be able to see the names of those who left complaints or usernames
    - We encourage activists to use usernames as their will be infiltrators
 
*BLOG: amplify marginalized voices in blogs by writing articles on allyship and experiences.Blogs will be used to engage and attract traffic to website/app ***


*** Sidebar for ads in the future to promote BIPOC businesses ***

#Priority 4: Tags and categorizing each racial experience.
    - which race was being targetted?
    - Was this a case of complacency or is the person/business to blame
    - The date of the occurrence
    - Manager or person in charge at the time of the incident
    - Person who instigated the racism // fullname or legal descriptin.

#Priority 5: Push notifications for ICE spottings/ alerts for who was arrested.
    - Push notifications for when someone is feeling unsafe due to racial pressures and may need assistances
    - Push notifications if someone is getting unlawfully arrested and needs people near by to record.

#Priority 6: Include sexism and sexual assault:
    - Allows survivors to out their rapist/assaulters without fear of a lengthy trial or having people know who you are. Some survivors fear pressing charges and would prefer to remain anonymous while also helping other women avoid abusers/assaulters.

    - Sexism in the workplace
    - Sexual harrassment
    - Ageism

    (In later versions I hope to also allow high school students and middle school students to review their schools and how they handle racism, bullying and ableism)
