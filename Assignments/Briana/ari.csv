'And I am alone a good deal just now John is kept in town very often by serious cases, and Jennie is good and lets me alone when I want her to. So I walk a little in the garden or down that lovely lane, sit on the porch under the roses, and lie down up here a good deal. I\'m getting really fond of the room in spite of the wallpaper. Perhaps because of the wallpaper. It dwells in my mind so!'
