    <h1 class="name">Guido van Rossum</h1>
    <h5>Creator of Python</h5>
    <p>Guido van Rossum is a Dutch programmer best known as the author of the Python programming language, for which he was the "Benevolent dictator for life" (BDFL) until he stepped down from the position in July 2018. He is currently a member of
      the Python Steering Council, however he has withdrawn from nominations for the 2020 Python Steering Council.</p>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.brainyquote.com/authors/guido-van-rossum-quotes">
      "Now, it's my belief that Python is a lot easier than to teach to students programming and teach them C or C++ or Java at the same time because all the details of the languages are so much harder. Other scripting languages really don't work
      very well there either."
