    <h6>In the words of Guido...</h6>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.brainyquote.com/authors/guido-van-rossum-quotes">
      "Now, it's my belief that Python is a lot easier than to teach to students programming and teach them C or C++ or Java at the same time because all the details of the languages are so much harder. Other scripting languages really don't work
      very well there either."
