# Capstone proposal
# Red Dirt Constrictors
## Outline
I am making a website for a reptile breeder. There will not be a e-commerce portion initially but will be a future feature. 

### The website must contain the following pages:
1. Landing page - contains a header image, call to action, last posted snakes, briefs company intro, testimonials?
2. Available snakes page (side nav) - contains a grid of available and recently sold snakes. Must be sortable and filterable. 
3. Contact us - a form for customers to inquire about a snake or the company. 
4. How to buy - a page explaining how to purchase a snake with appropriate links. 

### Possible additional pages:
1. Parent snakes - possibly a page displaying the parent snakes?
